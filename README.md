# TensorFlowExamples
Some basic usage examples of TensorFlow I prepared for a workshop at the University of Salamanca.

To run these notebooks you have to install numpy, matplotlib, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation) and (of course) [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#using-pip).
